# Smart Surveillance System Development Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step approach to building a real-time smart surveillance system using computer vision and deep learning. The system will detect suspicious activities such as unattended objects or unusual motion in restricted areas.

2. **Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Develop frame buffering for smooth processing
   - Implement background subtraction for motion detection
   - Create region of interest (ROI) selection for monitoring specific areas
   - Add frame rate optimization for real-time processing

## Phase 3: Object Detection Implementation

   - Develop trajectory tracking for movement analysis
   - Add object persistence across frames

## Phase 4: Anomaly Detection Logic

1. **Suspicious Activity Rules**
   - Define rules for unattended object detection
   - Implement restricted area violation detection
   - Create unusual movement pattern recognition
   - Develop time-based anomaly detection (objects stationary for too long)

2. **Anomaly Classification**
   - Create anomaly severity levels
   - Implement confidence scoring for detections
   - Add false positive filtering
   - Develop event logging system

## Phase 5: Alert System Development

1. **Twilio SMS Integration**
   - Set up Twilio account and credentials
   - Implement SMS sending functionality
   - Create alert message templates
   - Add throttling to prevent alert flooding

2. **Alert Management**
   - Develop alert priority system
   - Implement alert history and status tracking
   - Create alert acknowledgment mechanism
   - Add scheduled reporting functionality

## Phase 6: Web Dashboard Creation

1. **Flask Web Application**
